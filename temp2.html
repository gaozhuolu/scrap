    <p>(1) With respect to aggravated felony convictions, Immigration Judges must follow the law of the circuit court of appeals in whose jurisdiction they sit in evaluating issues of divisibility, so the interpretation of <em>Descamps v. United States</em>, 133 S. Ct. 2276 (2013), reflected in <em>Matter of Chairez</em>, 26 I&amp;N Dec. 349 (BIA 2014), applies only insofar as there is no controlling authority to the contrary in the relevant circuit.</p>

    <p>(2) Because the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has taken an approach to divisibility different from that adopted in <em>Matter of Chairez</em>, the law of the Tenth Circuit must be followed in that circuit.</p>

        <p>(1) For a statutory rape offense that may include a 16- or 17-year-old victim to be categorically "sexual abuse of a minor" under section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. Â§ 1101(a)(43)(A) (2012), the statute must require a meaningful age differential between the victim and the perpetrator. Matter of Rodriguez-Rodriguez, 22 I&amp;N Dec. 991 (BIA 1999), and Matter of V-F-D-, 23 I&amp;N Dec. 859 (BIA 2006), clarified.</p>

        <p>(2) The offense of unlawful intercourse with a minor in violation of section 261.5(c) of the California Penal Code, which requires that the minor victim be "more than three years younger" than the perpetrator, categorically constitutes "sexual abuse of a minor" and is therefore an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act.</p>

        <p>(2) An applicant for asylum or withholding of removal seeking relief based on "membership in a particular social group" must establish that the group is (1) composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic, (2) defined with particularity, and (3) socially distinct within the society in question.</p>

        <p>(3) An applicant has the burden of demonstrating not only the existence of a cognizable particular social group and his membership in that particular social group, but also a risk of persecution "on account of" his membership in that group.</p>

        <p>(4) The respondent did not establish that "former members of the Mara 18 gang in El Salvador who have renounced their gang membership" constitute a "particular social group" or that there is a nexus between the harm he fears and his status as a former gang member.</p>

        <p>(1) The United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime, Nov. 15, 2000, 2225 U.N.T.S. 209 ("UNTOC"), which is intended to help protect witnesses of transnational organized crime from retaliation and intimidation, does not provide an independent basis for relief from removal in immigration proceedings.</p>

        <p>(2) The objectives of the UNTOC are advanced in the United States through existing immigration laws and regulations, including the S, T, and U nonimmigrant visas and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted and opened for signature Dec. 10, 1984, G.A. Res. 39/46. 39 U.N. GAORSupp.No. 51, at 197,U.N.Doc.A/RES/39/708 (1984) (entered into force June 26, 1987; for the United States Apr. 18, 1988).</p>

        <p>(3) The Board of Immigration Appeals and the Immigration Judges do not have the authority to rule on the constitutionality of the statutes they administer and therefore lack jurisdiction to address a claimthat the statute barring relief for particularly serious crimes is void for vagueness.</p>
